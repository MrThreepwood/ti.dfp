1.1.1 - December 30, 2014

 - Merged PR #8 from timanrebel:

   - Added width/height to ad_received event, so it is easier to resize certain elements in the UI after loading an ad
 
   - adSizes now takes preference over adWidth/adHeight. Previously in 1.1.0 when no adWidth/Height, but adSizes were given, it would not work.

  (note -- I had a 1.0.1 version out there already for ios, but I don't want
  to get the version numbers out of sync for the two platforms, so I'm replacing
  ti.dfp-iphone-1.0.1.zip, which *was* using 6.12.0)
